# Welcome!

This is the website for the Biostatistics and Data Science Workshop, organized by Division of Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley.

# About the Workshop

### Background

Historically underrepresented minority (URM) students often face significant obstacles in accessing equitable educational opportunities, particularly in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). These challenges are most pronounced during the early stages of their education, notably in high school and at the start of their undergraduate studies. Early exposure to STEM disciplines, including programming and data analysis, is critical for these students as it not only provides the necessary skills and experiences for advanced research or graduate studies but also opens up new potential career paths.

With this in mind, the long-term goal of our Biostatistics Workshop is to offer URM students an opportunity for equitable exposure to programming and data analysis. By doing so, we aim to showcase how data science and biostatistics can be both engaging and valuable as potential career options. Importantly, this workshop is dedicated to addressing educational inequality, rather than simply increasing the number of URM applicants in our department.

### Workshop Overview

This two-day workshop provides an immersive experience in basic data analysis using R, a popular programming language in data science. Participants will engage in data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization tasks, with a special emphasis on datasets relevant to public health and biomedical fields.

In addition, the workshop provides:

**Research Exposure**: Participants will hear from faculty members and graduate students from the Biostatistics department at UC Berkeley, who will share insights into their groundbreaking research. Short seminars on soft skill development may also be included.

**Project Experience**: Following the initial sessions, participants are invited to spend an extra day working on mini-projects involving real-world data, and presenting their project proposals to their peers.

**Networking Opportunities**: Informal networking sessions will offer the chance for participants to connect with peers, graduate students, and faculty members over food and drinks.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the workshop, participants will:

- Develop basic skills in programming and data analysis.
- Gain practical experience in processing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
- Understand the daily tasks of a research scientist or data analyst to envision potential career paths.
- Explore interesting challenges and projects in public health and biomedical fields.
- Network with peers and faculty, potentially forging lifelong professional connections and friendships.

Yutong is a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. She is also the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) Student Fellow in Biostatistics. Yutong uses statistics and computer science to investigate how genetics affect human health, such as cancer biology and neuroscience. When not staring at her computer, Yutong loves climbing, hiking, reading, and baking.

## Kaitlyn Lee

Kaitlyn (she/her) is a 1st year MA/PhD student in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. She studies ways to quantify how different policies cause an outcome to change (for example, how lowering the speed limit on a street might change the number of car crashes). Outside of school and research, she likes going on runs with her dog, trying new ice cream flavors, and working on crossword puzzles. She's very excited to be a part of this workshop this weekend!

## Max Murphy

Max is a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. He works on analyzing the genetics of Malaria parasites, developing methods to understand how the parasite spreads through populations. When he's not working, you can find him playing and hiking with his dog Charlie, or playing video games with his brothers and partner.
